# MorpehZombie
Example of a Zombie game with Morpeh ecs framework

The focus of this project to to try out ECS with Morpeh.

Its the first time that I'm doing something with morpeh or ECS beyond theory.

So dont mind any rendering or animation issues. 

I was able to get on my Mac 8000 zombies without rendering (batching) them with 60 FPS.
